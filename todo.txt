bugs:
if the simulation is paused: some number of animals die once it restarts. Why??


high priority: (before first public alpha release)
adding a species should be easy and obvious
tag newly evolved creatures as evolved from an original ancestor (traceable to a user)
wrap a try catch around a user creating a new species 
information that a user enters when creating a species should be used (doesn't look like it is)
tutorial (in the same style as mooleer)
user administration


medium priority: (before first public beta release)
calculate a users score:
  total animals reproduced from my species
  total animals reproduced in my environment
show users their score
allow users to change their notification options
allow users to change their password
show all species on server
show all users with their scores
highlight currently selected animal
select a species needs to be more obvious
species colour system needs to be overhauled


low priority:
add corpses
 - corpses are the remains of animals that have run out of cpu, or died of natural causes
 - they contain the embodied value of the animal
 - animals can be birthed on top of a corpse, in which case the baby immediately gets the value of the corpse
 - corpses stay around forever (or until eaten)
make the grid resize itself. A rule like: at least 50% of the space should be empty.
should alloc have a cost?? perhaps related to the embodiedEnergy constant

backlog of ideas:
add a random (low) chance that an animal will die in any one round
debug mode: turn off mutations, turn off sending to server
