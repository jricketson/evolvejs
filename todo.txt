tag newly evolved creatures as evolved from an original ancestor (traceable to a user)
wrap a try catch around a user creating a new species 

information that a user enters when creating a species should be used (doesn't look like it is)

add corpses
 - corpses are the remains of animals that have run out of cpu, or died of natural causes
 - they contain the embodied value of the animal
 - animals can be birthed on top of a corpse, in which case the baby immediately gets the value of the corpse
 - corpses stay around forever (or until eaten)

add a random (low) chance that an animal will die in any one round

add a assembly command to LOOK
create an animal that looks

make the grid resize itself. A rule like: at least 50% of the space should be empty.
should alloc have a cost?? perhaps related to the embodiedEnergy constant

debug mode: turn off mutations, turn off sending to server



bugs:
logged in user isn't noticed in user interface
