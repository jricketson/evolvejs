bugs:
registration should not require referral source
seeing animal goes one too far when calculating distance to prey
jmp* should have no effect if the label that they are jumping to is not found
fix memory leaks
fix problem with process being set to null

high priority: (before first public alpha release)
better documentation
	the format for adding a species should be documented, and document the process
for scoring, two pieces of information need to be stored:
	which user created an species
	how much cputime has a user run
species chart/tree showing ancestors and descendants

medium priority: (before first public beta release)
statements that don't use operand should not be mutated on that
As a user I want to be able to tag interesting species from the simulation
tutorial
calculate a users score:
  total species evolved from my species
  total cputime run in my environment
  total species evolved
show users their score
allow users to change their notification options
allow users to change their password
show all users with their scores (allow users to opt out)
highlight currently selected animal
select a species needs to be more obvious
allow users to change the colour of a species
when number of animals is sent to server: should this be encrypted somehow?
	

low priority:
add corpses
 - corpses are the remains of animals that have run out of cpu, or died of natural causes
 - they contain the embodied value of the animal
 - animals can be birthed on top of a corpse, in which case the baby immediately gets the value of the corpse
 - corpses stay around forever (or until eaten)
make the grid resize itself. A rule like: at least 50% of the space should be empty.
should alloc have a cost?? perhaps related to the embodiedEnergy constant

backlog of ideas:
add a random (low) chance that an animal will die in any one round
debug mode: turn off mutations, turn off sending to server

animals:
animal does not cannibalise / how does the animal check that the other animal is the same species?
