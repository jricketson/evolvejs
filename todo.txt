bugs:
registration should not require referral source
seeing animal goes one too far when calculating distance to prey

high priority: (before first public alpha release)
better documentation
	the format for adding a species should be documented, and document the process
for scoring, two pieces of information need to be stored:
	which user created an species
	which user uploaded a set of births
counting how many animals have been created per species on the server is pointless, instead should be recording -1,0,+1 for went extinct, didn't succeed, succeeded(generated more than 100 animals as a proxy)
species chart/tree showing ancestors

medium priority: (before first public beta release)
tutorial (in the same style as mooleer)
calculate a users score:
  total species reproduced from my species
  total cputime run in my environment
show users their score
allow users to change their notification options
allow users to change their password
show all species on server
show all users with their scores
highlight currently selected animal
select a species needs to be more obvious
species colour system needs to be overhauled
allow users to change the colour of a species
when number of animals is sent to server: should this be encrypted somehow?
instead of sending births every power of ten: 
	maybe should just have a timer thread uploading what has happened over the last x minutes for successful species 
	

low priority:
add corpses
 - corpses are the remains of animals that have run out of cpu, or died of natural causes
 - they contain the embodied value of the animal
 - animals can be birthed on top of a corpse, in which case the baby immediately gets the value of the corpse
 - corpses stay around forever (or until eaten)
make the grid resize itself. A rule like: at least 50% of the space should be empty.
should alloc have a cost?? perhaps related to the embodiedEnergy constant

backlog of ideas:
add a random (low) chance that an animal will die in any one round
debug mode: turn off mutations, turn off sending to server

animals:
animal moves forward one and places baby behind it
animal does not cannibalise / how does the animal check that the other animal is the same species?
